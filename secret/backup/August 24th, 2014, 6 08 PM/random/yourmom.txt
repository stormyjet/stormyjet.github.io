Your Mom is so fat, she should really start seeing a doctor.
I heard a story about your mom once, something about a "Giant Beached Whale attacks downtown metropolitan area?"
Your Mom is so dumb, she couldn't figure out how to breathe. She died. I'm sorry for your loss.
Your Mom is fat. The end.
Your mom is so dumb she wrote a book on how to live, but she still died.
